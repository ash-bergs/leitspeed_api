## API Endpoints

**/CARDS - GET all Cards - endpoint**

The `Cards` database table can be accessed by making a GET request to the [https://leitspeed-api.herokuapp.com/cards](https://leitspeed-api.herokuapp.com/cards) endpoint.

The response will be an array of objects - each object being an individual card in the database.

---

**/CARDS/{id} - GET card by card ID - endpoint**

This API follows RESTful standards, using the `/cards` and `/cards/{id}` when working with one resource and a collection of resources. A card can be requested by its ID (given by the Node/Express server) - if it exists and hasn't been deleted, one JSON object will be delivered in the response. If the card can't be found a 404 will return.

A card can be accessed by making a GET request to the `https://leitspeed-api.herokuapp.com/cards/:id` endpoint with the requested card id following the last forward slash. Example: `https://leitspeed-api.herokuapp.com/cards/1`

---

**/CARDS/ADD-CARD - POST a new card - endpoint**

To add a new card, make a POST request to the [https://leitspeed-api.herokuapp.com/cards/add-card](https://leitspeed-api.herokuapp.com/cards/add-card) endpoint.

The request body will pass the new card's information - some of these fields are optional, others are not.

- ‚ùó Required fields:

  - front: The front of the new flashcard - the question, or whatever format the user wants to use to structure their study.
  - back: The back of the card - the answer

- ‚ùì Optional fields:
  - user_id: integer value, this field is a FOREIGN KEY linking to the `Users` database table
  - notes: text (string) field is where a user can add an additional note to their card, like a memory trick, etc.
  - public: boolean value - indicating if the card can be shared with other users
  - active: boolean value - indicating if the user is currently studying the card

The data structure of the request body should look as follows, in JSON format:

```
{
	"user_id": integer,
	"front": "text",
	"back": "text",
	"notes": "text",
	"active": boolean,
	"public": boolean
}
```

If the card meets all the requirements and is added to the `Cards` database table, it will respond with a JSON object containing the newly created card.

---

**/{id} - PUT request to UPDATE a card - endpoint**

To update an existing card, make a PUT request with the card's id injected into the route parameters to the `https://leitspeed-api.herokuapp.com/cards/:id` endpoint. The format must be in JSON (see the example above), and the `id`, `front` and `back` of a card **must** be given (even if they are not changing).

The server will respond with the newly updated card object.
